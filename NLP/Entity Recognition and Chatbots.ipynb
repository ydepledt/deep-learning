    "\n",
    "Named Entities can be viewed as instances of linguistic classes. For instance, there is an inifinite number of ways through which one might refer to a Location. Some examples could be \"Paris\", \"my house\", \"Japan\", \"the restaurant I like on Main Street\", etc... From a Named Entity Recognition (NER) perspective, all these examples would be specific **values** (or synonyms) refering to the **entity** \"location\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.a How are entities extracted by Rasa ?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Symbolic approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way of approaching Named Entity Extraction is to define all synonyms of an entity manually. In this case, the user would type all possible values of an entity manually. The extraction of these entities would then be performed by matching words in an utterance with the list of synonyms.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some cases where this mode of definition is appropriate. For instance, to define the entity \"*means of payment*\", there are only limited options (*cash*,*cheque*,*credit card*,*debit card*...). This approach, however, has two main issues :\n",
    "- the maintenance of synonym lists can quickly become impossible (for instance when defining entities corresponding to person or loction names)\n",
    "- this approach is not resilient to spelling variants (e.g. typing \"crdt card\" instead of \"credit card\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "The second issue can be mitigated by introducing \"flexible\" or \"fuzzy\" matching for entities (i.e. considering that a word that differs by only one character from one of the synonyms is still a match). However, in many cases, this is still imperfect.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Statistical approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Rasa relies on **extractors** for entities. For instance, the default CRFExtractor uses Conditional Random Fields fitted on word embeddings to predict whether a given word is an entity. In practice, that means that entities are detected using their representation, as well as the representations of the words in their surrounding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, using this approach means that giving enough examples in the form \"Quelle heure est-il à Paris\", \"quelle heure est-il à Londres\", etc... will enable the extractor to understand that in the pattern \"quelle heure est-il à ....\", the word following \"à\" is a \"location\".\n",
